# Real State Market Analysis for Tourist Rentals

This analysis project is part of a course in data science. The exercise simulates that we belong to a real estate company, and we carry out an analysis of tourist apartments with the objective of renting them out as tourist apartments.

Disclaimer: this project was initially done in Spanish, and later translated the important prose. It's a bit sloppy, next time I'll do it in English from the beggining.

### Overview of the project








##### Conclusions of the analysis

- we identified 10 neighborhoods that can maximize the cost-income ratio, and segmented them by type and quality.
- we found that the optimal option is to look for properties with one room that can accommodate 3 guests.
- for the scope of this analysis, it seems that proximity to points of interest is not very relevant.
- There's a market opportunity on renting properties in specific neiborhoods for moments of high sporting interest.
