# Real State Market Analysis for Tourist Rentals

This analysis project is part of a course in data science. The exercise simulates that we belong to a real estate company, and we carry out an analysis of tourist apartments with the objective of renting them out as tourist apartments.

Disclaimer: this project was initially done in Spanish, and later translated the important prose. It's a bit sloppy, next time I'll do it in English from the beggining.
