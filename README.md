# Real Estate Analytics: Tourist Rentals in Madrid & Valencia

## Overview
This project explores the short-term rental market (Airbnb) in Madrid and Valencia, aiming to uncover **profitable investment opportunities** and understand the key drivers of rental income.  
The analysis combines Airbnb listing data with external pricing information to estimate the **earnings potential of properties**, based on acquisition cost, occupancy ratios, and guest capacity.

## Process
1. **Data collection**  
   - Airbnb listings datasets for Madrid and Valencia (CSV).  
   - External pricing data scraped from real estate websites.  

2. **Data preparation**  
   - Cleaning, handling missing values, manual adjustments for district differences.  
   - Integration of multiple sources into a **SQLite database** (accessed with SQLAlchemy).  

3. **Analysis**  
   - Calculation of potential ROI for each apartment.  
   - Segmentation by district, property type, and guest capacity.  
   - Visualization of spatial patterns using **folium** maps.
